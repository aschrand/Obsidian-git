First of all, Capabilities and Value Stream are used to model what your company does in an organization **agnostic** way. Ie. Capabilities and Values Stream don't change when your company reorganizes itself by creating or merging Business Units or Departments. They both really represent what your company does, not how it does it or through which organization.

Capability and Value Stream differ in the way they are identified: Capabilities are usually generic and are big bunch of activities group logically, they are activities that your company is able to do (either by itself or through partnership), while Value Streams are defined based on the perceptible value and outcome for the end user. We also find a distinction which is similar to the one between function and process. Capabilities are thus used to model Enterprise at rest, while Value Stream model Enterprise in motion.


In strategy, they are used as the basis for your operating model: your first define the purpose of your business and its products and values through a Business Model Canvas, then your clarify which activities are needed for each product/value, then your check which capabilities must be there to support those values stream. At this point, you can start looking at how to organize your company and decide whether it seems best to have Business Units in charge of a whole Value Steam (usually best for client satisfaction), or in charge of a Capability, and thus supporting multiple Value Streams (usually best for efficiency and cost).

If not done, I would highly suggest you to read the books "Operating Model Canvas" (and maybe also  "Business Model Generation", the book which introduced Business Model Canvas).

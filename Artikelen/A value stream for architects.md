The take away from this article is the value stream diagram above, illustrating where enterprise and solution architects play their roles in changing business activity systems. It is *not* an organization structure. E.g. it says nothing about where Service Management sits, and yes, that should be close to business directors and managers.

The short-ish article below is edited from the longer exploration of architect roles in ["Enterprise and Solution Architecture: things to know"](https://bit.ly/2OlJVqr), Our industry is terminology torture. The terms used here reflect those defined in a) the international standard "Skills Framework for the Information Age", b) the British Computer Society's Professional Certificates for Enterprise and Solution Architecture, and c) TOGAF.

## **The context?**

The term "Enterprise Architecture" (EA) was coined in the 1980s in relation to the impact, in the "Information Age", of IT on business roles and processes that create and use business data. EA work should of course reflect the mission, vision, drivers and goals of a business, but it doesn't create them or architect *everything* that flows from them.

### **Business planning**

Business directors are responsible for business planning. They respond to business drivers by declaring strategic directions and top-level goals/objectives. Business planning may involve predicting demand and directing changes to any of the following.

- Constitution: mergers, acquisitions and divestments, opening/closing outlets.
- Market: industry domain/sector/segment, customers and suppliers.
- Products and services: pricing, sales and service channels.
- Relationships: partners, in-sourcing and out-sourcing of operations.
- Resources: people, wages, machines, locations/buildings and other physical asset types.
- Management structure: sacking or appointing CxOs and restructuring the organization.

Enterprise and solution architects may both stimulate and contribute to business planning, especially in information processing businesses. Not so much in a business that manufactures material things or provides face-to-face services. E.g. in a university, our kind of architect is not hired to architect the prospectus, courses, research projects, lectures, buildings, slide projectors or HVAC systems. On the other hand, whenever and wherever those things create or require business data, they may be of interest to EA.

### **Business system planning**

It has been said that “enterprise architecture regards the enterprise as a system, or system of systems”. A business is an organized social entity in which some/many information exchanges are regularized and repeatable. The activity systems of interest to enterprise and solution architects are primarily those in which business roles and processes create and use business data. These systems feature human/people and computer/technology actors performing regular activities to meet given aims/goals. The systems may be integrated with other business systems by the exchange of information, and changed under change control.

EA takes a cross-organizational and strategic view of such business activity systems. It works to integrate business system planning with business planning. The term solution architecture is used at a narrower and more tactical level; often in relation to one particular system, or a process that requires system integration.

Read article 3 for discussion of business architecture in EA.

### **Software development**

Enterprise architects work at the business function/capability and application portfolio level. Business-sponsored software development projects (agile or not) emerge from application portfolio management and other high level architectural thinking.

Solution architects work below that level and identify the major use cases/epics that applications provide to their users. A solution architect may shape and steer a development project, keep it on the rails and in step with more strategic cross-organizational thinking.

Given a list of use cases or epics, an application may be developed (as in phase G of TOGAF') using whatever agile and dev-ops techniques are helpful, provided there is some oversight from an architect with a view to the wider enterprise architecture.

\*A software architect \*may elaborate a given solution architecture, complete the component structure and APIs of an application, and address the detailed design of messaging between applications or components.

## **Other questions**

### How many architect roles?

The number of roles called “architect” varies widely between organizations. Some enterprises have never set up an EA practice; some have done so and struggled to make an impact. However, many do have a team called “strategy and architecture” or the like. Every enterprise has to work out for itself how its roles cover the cells of the table below.

Read ["Enterprise and Solution Architecture: things to know"](https://bit.ly/2OlJVqr) for more on the history of architecture roles, and how they are defined in standards such as the "Skills Framework for the Information Age" and TOGAF.

### Can enterprise and solution architects use the same framework?

Architecture frameworks generally share a similar *process.* In essence:

1.  envision change
2.  design change
3.  plan change
4.  govern change.

However, they feature different *products* for enterprise architecture (e.g. portfolio-level road maps) and solution architecture (e.g. project-level solution outlines or SADs). There are two ways to adapt a generalized framework.

- Specialize the activities for use by enterprise or solution architects. E.g. TOGAF's ADM is a highly generalized management framework for "architecture projects" at any level. You may adapt it for use by enterprise and by solutions architects.
- Sequence the activities of enterprise and solution architecture. The graphic above shows a way to sequence them in one architecture framework - overlapping at the solution vision stage.

In any case, for each situation or initiative you must select relevant processes and products. Read: [[What TOGAF is and is not]]

### Who do enterprise and solution architects work with?

Every enterprise must integrate the processes of an architecture framework with that organization's processes for

- program or project management (PMO),
- business change management, and
- IT services management (ITSM) and business operations management

Avancier Methods are presented primarily as a solution architecture framework, but they include portfolio analysis, and can be adapted for enterprise architecture. We don't run courses in Avancier Methods, but we do draw on them in teaching the enterprise and solution architecture training courses advertised [here](http://avancier.website/).

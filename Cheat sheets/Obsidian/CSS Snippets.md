# What’s a snippet?

Snippets are CSS files that allow you to create your own personal customizations on top of Minimal (or any Obsidian theme). You can install snippets by adding CSS files to the `.obsidian/snippets` folder in your vault, and activating them in Obsidian by going to `Settings` → `Appearance`.

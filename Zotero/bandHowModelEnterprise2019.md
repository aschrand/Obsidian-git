Open FAIR Risk Taxonomy [2] In this taxonomy, “risk” is defined as the probable frequency and probable magnitude of future loss, which means that the risk definition is dependent on two factors: loss event frequency and probable loss magnitude. Then, recursively, each one of the rest of the factors is defined until the lower branches for the model are reached. For example, in the left branch of the model, the loss event frequency is dependent on threat event frequency and vulnerability.” Yellow Highlight [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/83PSDIG8?page=12&annotation=M2MAQ5W3) 
 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and security are closely interlinked with Enterprise Architecture, particularly in the design of organizations and the IT applications and infrastructure that support them. Therefore, this White Paper demonstrates how ERM and Security Architectures can be expressed in the ArchiMate language for Enterprise Architecture modeling. In order to identify the relevant concepts, this White Paper examines a wide variety of standards and frameworks for ERM and security deployment, including those employed in the risk and security-related activities of The Open Group. Based on this, the paper establishes a common set of risk and security concepts, and demonstrates a mapping of these concepts to the ArchiMate language. Example cases illustrate these concepts.” Yellow Highlight [Page 40](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/83PSDIG8?page=40&annotation=Q59QT9LJ)

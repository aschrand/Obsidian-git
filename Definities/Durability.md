# Durability
---
Durability relates to software's serviceability and ability to meet users' needs for a relatively long time. Things to consider include:

-   **Replication**: ShareÂ information to ensure consistency between redundant resources to improve reliability, fault-tolerance, or accessibility.
-   **Fault tolerance**: This enables a system to continue operating correctly in the event of one or more faults within some of its components.
-   **Archivability**: This manages whether the data needs to be archived or deleted after a period of time. For example, customer accounts will be deleted after three months or marked as obsolete and archived in a secondary database for future access.

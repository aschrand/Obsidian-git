# Usability

---
Usability is a system's capacity to enable users to perform tasks safely, effectively, and efficiently while enjoying the experience. It is the degree to which specified consumers can use software to achieve quantified objectives with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a quantified context of use. Related factors include:

-   **Accessibility**: Make the software available to people with the broadest range of characteristics and capabilities, includingÂ users with deafness, blindness, colorblindness, and more.
-   **Learnability**: Make the software easy for users to learn.
-   **API contract**: Internal teams need to understand the API contracts to help them plug into any system.

# Agility
---
Agile is a software method that enables a team to respond to changes quickly. Software development is all about modification, so agility is a key NFR. Key factors include:

-   **Maintainability**: How easy is it to apply changes and enhance the system? Maintainability represents the degree to which developers can effectively and efficiently modify the software to improve, correct, or adapt it to changes in the environment and requirements.
    -   _Testability:_ How easily can developers and others test the software?
    -   _Ease of development:_ Can developers modify the software without introducing defects or degrading existing product quality?
-   **Deployability**: This is the time it takes to get code into production.
    -   _Installability:_ How easy is system installation on all necessary platforms?
    -   _Upgradeability:_ How quick and easy is it to upgrade from a previous version of an application or solution to a newer version on servers and clients?
    -   _Portability:_ Does the system need to run on more than one platform?
-   **Configurability**: How easily can end users change aspects of the software's configuration (through usable interfaces)?
-   **Compatibility**: How well can a product, system, or component exchange information with other products, designs, or members and perform its required functions while sharing the same hardware or software environment?

# Extensibility
---
Extensibility measures the ability to extend a system and the effort required to implement the extension. The extension can occur by adding new functionality or modifying existing functionality. The principle provides enhancements without impairing current system functions. When architecting extensibility, consider:

-   **Modularity and reusability**: Reusability, together with extensibility, allows technology to be transferred to another project with less development and maintenance time, as well as enhanced reliability and consistency.
-   **Pluggability**: This is the ability to easily plug in other components, for example with microkernel architecture.

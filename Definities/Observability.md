# Observability

---
Observability is the ability to collect data about program execution, modules' internal states, and communication between components. To improve observability, use various logging and tracing techniques and tools, including the following:

-   **Logging**: There are different types of logs generated within each request, such as event logs, transaction logs, message logs, and server logs.
-   **Alerts and monitoring**: Prepare monitoring dashboards, create service-level indicators (SLIs), and set up critical alerts.
-   **Tiered levels of support**: Set up on-call support processes for Level 1 and Level 2 support. L1 support includes interacting with customers. L2 support manages the tickets escalated by L1 and helps troubleshoot. L3 is the last line of support and usually comprises a development team that addresses the technical issues.

There are four types of machine learning:

-   **Supervised learning**: (also called inductive learning) Training data includes desired outputs.  This is spam this is not, learning is supervised.
-   **Unsupervised learning**: Training data does not include desired outputs. Example is clustering. It is hard to tell what is good learning and what is not.
-   **Semi-supervised learning**: Training data includes a few desired outputs.
-   **Reinforcement learning**: Rewards from a sequence of actions. AI types like it, it is the most ambitious type of learning.

Supervised learning is the most mature, the most studied and the type of learning used by most machine learning algorithms. Learning with supervision is much easier than learning without supervision.

Inductive Learning is where we are given examples of a function in the form of data (_x_) and the output of the function (_f(x)_). The goal of inductive learning is to learn the function for new data (_x_).

-   **Classification**: when the function being learned is discrete.
-   **Regression**: when the function being learned is continuous.
-   **Probability Estimation**: when the output of the function is a probability.

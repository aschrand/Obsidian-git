# Why Use Server Virtualization
[[Server Virtualization Definition]]
- Server virtualization conserves space through ==consolidation==.
- Server virtualization provides a way for companies to practice ==redundancy== without purchasing additional hardware. Redundancy refers to running the same application on multiple servers.
- Virtual servers offer programmers ==isolated==, independent systems in which they can test new applications or operating systems.
- Server hardware will eventually become ==obsolete==, and switching from one system to another can be difficult

The main advantages of using virtual machines vs a time-sharing operating system was a more efficient use of the system since virtual machines were able to share the overall resources of the mainframe, instead of having the resources split equally between all users. There was better security since each user was running in a completely separate operating system. And it was more reliable since no one user could crash the entire system; only their own operating system.

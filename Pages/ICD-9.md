The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) is based on the World Health Organization’s Ninth Revision, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9). ICD-9-CM is the official system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the United States. The [ICD-9](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9.htm) was used to code and classify mortality data from death certificates until 1999, when use of ICD-10 for mortality coding started.

The ICD-9-CM consists of:

-   a tabular list containing a numerical list of the disease code numbers in tabular form;
-   an alphabetical index to the disease entries; and
-   a classification system for surgical, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures (alphabetic index and tabular list).

The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servicesexternal icon](https://www.cms.gov/) are the U.S. governmental agencies responsible for overseeing all changes and modifications to the ICD-9-CM.

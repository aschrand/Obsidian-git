## Resist the urge to interrupt, plan your next comment, or judge the other

person. Use nonverbal behavior—such as leaning forward and nodding—to
demonstrate that you’re really paying attention.

## GIVE YOUR FULL ATTENTION

Ask open-ended questions to encourage the other person to clarify their
perceptions of what’s important and why. Start your questions with phrases such as:
• “How do you feel about…”
• “What happened when…”
• “Tell me about…”

## ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS

Periodically paraphrase what you’re hearing, being sure to reflect the emotions
as well as the content of the message:
• “As I understand it, your position is…”
• “You seem to be concerned about…”
If the other person disagrees with your paraphrasing, ask them to clarify the
point. Then paraphrase again to see if you accurately understand the message.

## PARAPHRASE TO SHOW UNDERSTANDING

In addition to comments of agreement from the other person, body language
such as smiling, nodding, leaning forward, and sighs of relief also suggests that
you're on the right track.

## START WITH INQUIRY RATHER THAN BLAME

When people feel attacked, they’re unlikely to acknowledge any role they may
have played in the dispute. Begin by inquiring about how the other person
views the situation.

## CLEARLY SAY WHAT YOU MEAN

To prevent your listener from receiving the wrong message—and worsening
the situation—communicate plainly and directly, without euphemisms or
confusing language.

## DON’T FORGET NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION

Make sure your stance, gestures, tone of voice, and facial expressions are
open and nonthreatening.

## USE NONCONFRONTATIONAL LANGUAGE

Put the other person at ease by acknowledging it’s a difficult situation for
both of you. For example, you might say, “I’m really troubled by what happened
in the planning meeting yesterday. Are you open to talking about it?”
